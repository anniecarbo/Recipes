    <h3>This recipe is originaly from <a href="https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/caramelized-honey-pumpkin-pie">Claire Saffitz</a></h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 all-butter pie shell, parbaked in a 9-inch pie plate and cooled</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>¹⁄3 cup honey</li>
        <li>¾ cup heavy cream, at room temperature</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>¼ cup packed dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 can unsweetened pumpkin puree</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons ground ginger</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>   
        <li>½ teaspoon ground allspice</li>   
        <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg </li>   
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cloves</li>           
        <li>Softly whipped cream, for serving</li>     
    </ul>   
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Arrange an oven rack in the center position and preheat the oven to 325°F. Place the parbaked pie crust on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan, cook the butter over medium-low heat, stirring and scraping the bottom and sides constantly with a heatproof spatula. The mixture will sputter as the water boils off. Continue to cook, stirring and scraping, until the sputtering subsides, the butter is foaming, and the solid bits turn a dark brown, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the saucepan from the heat and immediately add the honey (to prevent the butter from burning), stirring to combine. Return the saucepan to medium heat and bring to a boil. Continue to cook, swirling often, until the mixture is darkened slightly and has a savory, nutty smell, about 2 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat and slowly stream in the heavy cream, stirring constantly (be careful—the mixture may sputter) until it’s smooth. Set the warm honey mixture aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk the eggs to break up the whites and yolks, then add the brown sugar and whisk vigorously until the mixture has lightened in color by a shade or two, about 1 minute. Whisk in the pumpkin, cinnamon, ginger, vanilla, salt, allspice, nutmeg, and cloves until smooth. Slowly stream in the warm honey mixture, whisking constantly, until the filling is completely homogenous.</li>
        <li>Pour the filling into the parbaked crust all the way to the top. (Depending on the height of your crust, you may have some leftover filling, which I recommend you keep! Ever so carefully transfer the pie to the center rack and bake until the filling is set and puffed around the edges and the center wobbles gently, 45 to 60 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn off the oven and prop the door open with a wooden spoon. Let the pie cool completely in the oven. Doing so will allow it to cool gradually, which will prevent cracking on the surface.</li>
        <li>Slice the pie into wedges and top each piece with softly whipped cream. Grate a bit of fresh nutmeg over the cream and serve.</li>
    
    </ol>
